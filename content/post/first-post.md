Welcome to Catabolic Coffee!! We hope you like our new website ^-^

### Introduction

> Here at Catabolic Coffee, contemporary social activist meets a sustainably purr-fect relaxation. Drop by anytime to kick back, drink complimentary tea, and partake in cat-therapy. Or, meet up with peers to plan your next startup, all the while drinking organic, free-trade lattes and sampling pastries made with locally sourced ingredients. We are all about progress, from our ethical business practices, to our nightly empowerment speaker series and slam poetry sessions. Our cats are rescued from local shelters and housed in the cafe until adopted by loving patrons. A visit to Catabolic Coffee can change a life one cup or cat at a time.
